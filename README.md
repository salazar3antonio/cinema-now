- Connects model components to corresponding XML views with Data Binding
- Accesses the deviceâ€™s GPS sensor for accurate [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com/) API calls
- Executes coroutines to fetch API data asynchronously 
- Saves persistent data locally with Room (SQLite)
- Uses Intents to pull up the dialer app for calling theaters and Google Mpas for turn-by-turn navigation.
- Applied modern Material user interface components from [Material.io](https://material.io/)
